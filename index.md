## Learning emerging best practices

*Organiser*: Professor Alex Holcombe, School of Psychology, The University of Sydney

*Venue*: Law 132 Seminar Room, Faculty of Law Building, Sandy Bay Campus, The University of Tasmania

*Date*: Wednesday 4th April 2018.

*Time*: 1pm â€“ 5pm

New methodological practices can help ensure that study results are reproducible and robust. Some of these practices are being adopted rapidly, in part because journals and research funders are incentivising them. An additional reason is that some of the practices can actually make our research lives easier! This symposium will be a how-to session covering study preregistration ("Preregistration is cramping my style... is it worth it?", presented by Kim Ransley), reproducible data analysis with R and RMarkdown (Charles Ludowici), and doing Bayesian statistics with JASP ([Chris Donkin](http://www.psy.unsw.edu.au/contacts-people/academic-staff/dr-chris-donkin)).  Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops and will receive details of what software to install for any interactive  bits of the symposum. Specifics will be posted at https://alexholcombe.github.io/EPC18sympos/index.html
