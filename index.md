“Learning emerging best practices” has been organised by Professor Alex Holcombe (School of Psychology, The University of Sydney). Methodological practices that ensure that our findings are robust and reproducible are sweeping the field. In part this is because journals and research funders are incentivising these practices, but another aspect is that some of them can actually make our lives easier. This tutorial session will cover topics including study preregistration (presented by Kim Ransley), reproducible data analysis with R and RMarkdown (Charles Ludowici), and doing Bayesian statistics with JASP (Chris Donkin). Specifics will be posted at
