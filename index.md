## Learning emerging best practices

*Organiser*: Professor Alex Holcombe, School of Psychology, The University of Sydney (alex.holcombe@sydney.edu.au)

*Venue*: Law 132 Seminar Room, Faculty of Law Building, Sandy Bay Campus, The University of Tasmania

*Date*: Wednesday 4th April 2018.

*Time*: 1pm â€“ 5pm

New methodological practices can help ensure that study results are reproducible and robust. Some of these practices are being adopted rapidly, in part because journals and research funders are incentivising them. An additional reason is that some of the practices can actually make our research lives easier! This symposium will be a how-to session covering study preregistration ("Preregistration is cramping my style... is it worth it?", presented by Kim Ransley), reproducible data analysis with R and RMarkdown (Charles Ludowici), and doing Bayesian statistics with JASP ([Chris Donkin](http://www.psy.unsw.edu.au/contacts-people/academic-staff/dr-chris-donkin)).  Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops and will receive details of what software to install for any interactive  bits of the symposum. Specifics will be posted at https://alexholcombe.github.io/EPC18sympos/index.html

1.00ish (start time depends on how long it takes people to find the place). **Improving how science is done and the changing academic landscape** - Alex Holcombe (the University of Sydney) will speak for 30 min or less, followed by discussion.

2.00 **Preregistration is cramping my style... is it worth it?**  - Kim Ransley (PhD student, the University of Sydney)

3.00 **Reproducible data analysis with R and RMarkdown** - Charles Ludowici (PhD student, the University of Sydney)

4.00 **Doing Bayesian statistics with JASP** - Associate Professor Chris Donkin (UNSW Australia)

<!-- After questions about my presentation, we could then have instructions on screen , and us roving around, to help those who don't have JASP and Rmarkdown with RStudio installed.  For those who don't have eduroam and failed to request that EPC get them an account, I might mobile hotspot my phone so they can download things. -->


### Preparing to attend

You are encouraged to bring your laptop, and if you do please install:

* [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/)
* Follow these steps to install rMarkdown
    * [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    * [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
    * Open RStudio and run this command `install.packages('rmarkdown')`. Make sure you're connected to the internet.

If you happen to be associated with an Australian university (or many UK universities), you should have wi-fi access through eduroam (before leaving your home university, make sure you have eduroam working there). If you cannot get eduroam, if you contact the conference organisers well in advance (e.g. Helen Derbyshire <helen.derbyshire@utas.edu.au>) with your name, email, and mobile number, they will attempt to get you a login for the university wifi.
